What I practiced in this File:
- Created a recursive function to test if a number is prime
- Used that same function to iterate through a loop that divides a prime number with the natural number. Then it'll add each of the prime
to the array list.

This program outputs a given natural number's prime factors and the number of factors it has. Array lists weren't really necessary 
because a counter variable can be created instead; however, the output is more readable.
