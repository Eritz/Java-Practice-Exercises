In the `src` folder there is a standalone terminal version of a password generator and a folder with the GUI version. 

What I practiced in this file:
- Scanner class
- Char to String
- Math.random
- Random.nextInt()
- Java Swing

This was challenge # 4 from r/dailyprogrammer. This program is designed to generate a password with a given length. 
The passwords can be purely alphabetical, alphanumeric, or alphanumeric with symbols.

ASCII: 1-26 is A-Z, 97-122 is a-z, and 33-47 & 144-152 are symbols.
